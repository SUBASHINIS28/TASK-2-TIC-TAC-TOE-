# TASK-2-TIC-TAC-TOE-
This Python program implements a console-based Tic Tac Toe game for two players. It displays a 3x3 board where players take turns entering row and column coordinates to place their marks ('X' or 'O'). The game announces the winner or a tie and continues until a result is reached.
